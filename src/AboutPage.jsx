                <p>I am a passionate designer and web developer with a love for creating seamless, intuitive, and visually compelling digital experiences. 
                    I believe that design is not just about how things look, but about how they work and how they make people feel.
                    With a strong foundation in both design principles and web development, I bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality.
                    Whether Iâ€™m crafting pixel-perfect UI/UX designs, writing clean code, or optimizing websites for performance,
                    my goal is always to build something that not only looks great but also delivers results.
                </p>
